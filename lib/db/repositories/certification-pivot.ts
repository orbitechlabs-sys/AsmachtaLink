 * WHAT THIS USED TO GET WRONG. The previous version was a `COUNT(*)` over roster rows with
 * no status filter at all, so a soldier marked "לא עבר הסמכה" and a soldier marked
 * "עבר הסמכה" both added 1 to the same number, and עתודה rows were counted alongside them.
 * On a certification whose own status was "בוצעה" that read as "everyone completed it".
 * Completion is now a per-soldier decision, made in one place, for both the bars and the
 * detail table — see lib/roster/completion.ts.
 *
 * ONE QUERY, driven off `battalions` so a selected battalion with no matching soldiers
 * still comes back as a bar of zero.
 *
 * THE CERTIFICATION FILTERS LIVE INSIDE THE DERIVED TABLE, not in the outer WHERE. That is
 * load-bearing: filtering after the LEFT JOIN turns it back into an inner join, and a
 * battalion whose only roster rows fall outside the date window then vanishes from the
 * chart instead of showing an honest zero.
